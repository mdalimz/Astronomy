- @The Sloan Digital Sky Survey or SDSS is a major multi-spectral imaging and spectroscopic redshift survey using a dedicated 2.5-m wide-angle optical telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, United States. The project began in 2000 and was named after the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, which contributed significant funding.

____Recall that “color” can be defined as the difference between any two magnitudes measured in different filters (e.g., g-r, i-z, etc.,), and angular size can be approximated using the measured radius enclosing 90 percent of an object’s light (p.petror90_r).
